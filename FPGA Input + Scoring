FPGA Input Legend:
(SW17) rst
(SW16) restart: hard restart that begins a new game regardless of win/loss status, game won’t start until switch it turned off
(SW15) player_pause: switch on for game to run/play, switch off to pause game
(SW14) player_new_game: on- new game will start immediately after a win/loss. I recommend leaving it off until a win/loss occurs then flip it on and off, but you do you. I am not responsible for any chronic finger cramps resulting from marathon brick breaking binges.
